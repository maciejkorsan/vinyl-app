# GrooveTracker ðŸŽµ  

GrooveTracker is a lightweight, real-time music tracker built with **Hotwire** and **Ruby on Rails**. It leverages **Turbo Drive, Turbo Streams, Turbo Frames**, and **Stimulus** to deliver a seamless, reactive experienceâ€”without the need for heavy JavaScript frameworks.    

## ðŸŽ¬ Built for Arkency's Webinar  
GrooveTracker was created specifically for **Arkency's webinar "From React to Hotwire"**, showcasing how moving away from React can simplify frontend development.  
The webinar walks through Turbo Drive, Streams, Frames, and compares them to common React patterns.
